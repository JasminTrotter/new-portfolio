  "bio": "I find the process of creating deeply rewarding. I am in my element when  engaged in deep work on a meaningful project. Through this process, if I am able to master a hard thing (or at least improve by a little bit) I feel on top of the world. Beyond all else, I value creatively producing high quality code solutions. Code modularity, reusability, efficiency, readability, and testability are considerations at the forefront of my mind each time I sit down at the keyboard. In my free time I stay active, practice mindfulness meditation, and geek out over Myers-Briggs.",
